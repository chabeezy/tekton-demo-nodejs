# Tekton Demo

Demo of linting, testing, building and running a Hello World Node app
using [Tekton][tekton].

[Tekton][tekton] is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration
and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets users build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises
systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.
